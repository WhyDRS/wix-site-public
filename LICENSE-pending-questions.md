This project was initialized through the default "open-source" Wix integration, which publishes all JavaScript custom functions implemented on the proprietary site hosting pages. Aside from these functions under `src/pages`, there are some reminiscent Wix-specific "Velo" integration functions in `src/backend` and `src/public`.

Given that none of the present website functionality employs these tools, I ask James if they need any of this. If not, I endorse removing them so that the entire repo's licensing is much simpler.
