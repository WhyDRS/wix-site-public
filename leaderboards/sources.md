DRS Leaderboard - Lists most recent DRS reporting figures from 10-Q and 10-K financial reports as a percent of outstanding shares. Currently we know of two companies reporting this information, but WhyDRS would love to encourage this kind of reporting from all public companies.

Record Holder Leaderboard - Lists total number of record holders. Record holders must be reported annually in 10-K financial reports by all public companies. In order to populate this list initially, an intensive manua scraping process was done to gather companies with large amounts of record holders. 

We'll need to be prepared as the 10Ks are released to keep this page updated. Currently using 10K from 2022. Could update to 2023 but the 2024 10Ks will be out fairly soon.
