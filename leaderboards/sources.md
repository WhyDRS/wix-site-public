## Record Holder Leaderboard 

Lists total number of record holders. Record holders must be reported annually in 10-K financial reports by all public companies. In order to populate this list initially, an intensive manua scraping process was done to gather companies with large amounts of record holders. 

We'll need to be prepared as the 10Ks are released to keep this page updated. Currently using 10K from 2022. Below is information for 2023, and we'll be able to update in 2024 in a couple months.
